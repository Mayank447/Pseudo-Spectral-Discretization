# Pseudo-Spectral-Discretization

# DiracOperator Class

The `DiracOperator` class implements the Dirac operator with methods for applying it to vectors in real-space and spectral representation. It takes a spectrum as defined below.

# Spectrum

Spectra are defined as classes which provide, among other things, knowledge about the eigenvalues and the transformations between real and spectral space.
