# Pseudo-Spectral-Discretization

# DiracOperator Class

The `DiracOperator` class implements the Dirac operator with methods for applying it to spectral coefficients, computing eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, generating a lattice structure, and transforming values between time and frequency spaces.
